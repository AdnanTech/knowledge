## What is biohacking?

Biohacking can be defined as the attempt to manipulate your brain and body in order to **optimize performance**, outside the realm of _traditional medicine_

## What are my biohacking techniques?

### Waking up

Use a wake-up light, to imitate natural sunrise, which wakes your body up easier. As well as keeping a phone across the room so I have to get out of bed to turn it off. These 2 features allow me to wake up during very early hours of the morning, arond 4am, so I can tackle my goals first thing in the day.
