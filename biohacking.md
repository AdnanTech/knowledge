# Biohacking

## What is biohacking?

Biohacking can be defined as the attempt to manipulate your brain and body in order to **optimize performance**, outside the realm of _traditional medicine_. Below are my current biohacking techniques.

## Eyes

### Blue light blocking glasses

Wearing [glasses ](https://www.amazon.co.uk/DUCO-Anti-Glare-Protection-Anti-Fatigue-Smartphone/dp/B071DGFZG7?th=1)that have a blue light filter, or using f.lux to **reduce eye strain** when staring at screen for extended periods of time. This allows you to work for longer.

### Eye drops

Using eye drops to restore and lubricate my eyes. Vision is important and should be appreciated, thus I try to take good care of them.

### **Wake up light**

Use a wake-up light, to imitate natural sunrise, which wakes your body up easier, and allow your eyes to be adjusted easier as well. Also, I keep my phone across the room so I have to get out of bed to turn the alarm on it off. These 2 features allow me to wake up during very early hours of the morning, arond 4am, so I can tackle my goals first thing in the day.
