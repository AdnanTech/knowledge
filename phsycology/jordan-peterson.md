## [What To Do To Be Successul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWUplunwGgc)

* To be successful, there are some predictors of lifetime success.
  * **IQ**
    * This _can't be changed_, your fluid IQ starts to decrease as soon as you hit 20, the best solution to _slow it down_? **Physical exercise**. Anaerobic and aerobic.
      * This is to keep your brain clean and well oxygenated
  * **The Big 5**
    * **Extraversion-**  a personality trait typically characterized by outgoingness, high energy, and/or talkativeness. In general, the term refers to a state of being where someone “recharges,” or draws energy, from being with other people; the opposite—drawing energy from being alone—is known as introversion.
    * **Neuroticism** **-**  defined as a tendency toward anxiety, depression, self-doubt, and other negative feelings. All personality traits, including neuroticism, exist on a spectrum—some people are just much more neurotic than others. Neuroticism is sometimes described as low emotional stability or negative emotionality.
    * **Agreeableness -**  a personality trait that can be described as cooperative, polite, kind, and friendly. People high in agreeableness are more trusting, affectionate, altruistic, and generally displaying more prosocial behaviors than others. People high in this prosocial trait are particularly empathetic, showing great concern for the welfare of others, they are the first to help those in need.
    * **Conscientiousness** - A personality trait that reflects the tendency to be responsible, organized, hard-working, goal-directed, and to adhere to norms and rules. It's mainly genetic, although can be improved. A conscientious person is good at self-regulation and impulse control. This trait influences whether you will set and keep long-range goals, deliberate over choices, behave cautiously or impulsively, and take obligations to others seriously.
      * Set up **clear, specified** _goals_ to reach, so you know when you succeed or fail
        * These align with the clear **topics of life** goals
        * Set up a schedule to have the BEST day you can, it should be enjoyable to an extent, obviously there are resposibilities, but the goal is to be better than the start of the day.
        * Even if you improve 1%, we get a positive feedback loop and spiral upwards
      * Micro habits/processes to reach the goals
    * **Openness -**  a personality trait denoting receptivity to new ideas and new experiences
  * **Social Network**
  * **Specific skills**
  * **Interest**

At university, we should be figuring out who I want to be, and use everything I learnt, and build the person I WANT to be, and not what I SHOULD be. I should be successful is meaningless, it's empty and bad self critisiscm. Whereas I want to be successful implies you can devise a plan and a routine to reach the _subjective_ success more and more everyday, and once you reach the success, it's likely you will **repeat the process** with even **bigger goals**.
