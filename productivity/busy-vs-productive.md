# Busy vs Productive

## Outline

Being busy is **not** being productive. All notes are extracted from the following short video; [Busy People vs. Productive People](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTy-Fy3M00k).

| Busy | Productive |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Many goals**: Always trying to achieve lots of goals at once, and end up not achieving a lot in the grand scheme of things over time | **Priorities**: Hone in what _needs_ to be done and **do not multi task**, focus and sort taks by priority, and critical priorities are tackled first thing in the day. Only once a task is completed can you complete the following task |
| **Yes to everything**: This will fill up your schedule with meaningless tasks that do not get you towards your goals | **Automatically says no unless well calculated**: Having less can mean more clarity, creation and production. |
|  | **No distractions and no sidetracks** |
| **Get things done on time**: Procrastinate to the last minute as you have time to do other tasks until that date. | **Set absolutely unrealistic short deadlines:** Work as if your life depends on it and you will get tasks that you thought would take a month, done in a few days. This forces you into immediate action. |
| Fill up their to do list with over 20 items: To feel extra productive when it only makes you look busy, and doesnt make you more productive | Only have 1 to 3 tasks on a to do list: Sorted in priority, with every task being important and neccessary for the day. If the vision is clear, the success becomes a reality. |
