# Phone

## Integrating my phone into my workflow

It's 2020, we have extremely powerful mini computers in our pockets, along with a vast network of interconnected computers. These have smart phone apps that allow you stay on top of things. For example, I can CRUD \(Create, Read, Update, Delete\) events from my calendar from my phone, I can CRUD a new journal entry, I can add to my private notes in Notion with my phone, set a pomodoro timer and more. The consensus is that a phone, if used correctly, can aid your workflow when it is inconvenient to bring a laptop out or you just currently do not have a laptop on you.

## During Work

During work, the phone stays away from me, on the other side of my room, on do not disturb. This is so that I do not get distracted by mindlessly going on apps and such. The other approach is to have enough willpower to not touch it, but this requires energy, I wanted the habit of going on my phone during work to be[ difficult, unattractive, invisible and unsatisfying](../cognitive-science/metacognition/untitled-1.md#how-to-break-a-bad-habit-the-opposite).
