# Information Overload

## What is Information Overload?

Information Overload is the exposure to or provision of too much information or data. This has gotten inherently worse over time as it is easier to access an abundance of information from social media, rss feeds, blogs, texts and the media.

## Why is it bad?

Information is good, but just like anything, when consumed in high doses unmoderated, it can be bad. It's common knowledge the brain uses energy when thinking, processing information can also be seen as thinking. Therefore consuming and processing **redundant** information advocates processing information about **redundant** topics. Which in turn takes energy, and therefore means you have less energy to complete tasks of high importance.

## How do I reduce constant consumption of information?

* Reduce time on Social Media, the worst culprits are endlessly scrolling applications
  * YouTube \(and YouTube comments\)
  * Instagram
  * Snapchat Stories
  * News articles
  * Twitch streams

## How do I consume the right Information?

**Be resourceful**. This means weeding out what is **important to you** and what isn't. A lot of information is redundant, common sense, or easily summed up in an article or 5 minute video rather than a book. So tips for increasing resourceful

* Use book reviews to find out if the book is worth your time in the first place.
* Google book summaries to read an abridged version of all the important key points. Don't be afraid to ask people on social media sites like Reddit or FB. You can even find some nice ones on YouTube.
* Use the table of contents and use that to determine what you should read and avoid.
* A lot of these books usually have a chapter summary. Read those.
* Skip examples given in books after you understand the key idea. It can get redundant at times.
* This is an addition to what was previously mentioned but realize that the most popular books that provide the most value will more than likely have a summary out there.
