# Long/Short Breaks

So a problem I sometimes have during my pomodoro breaks is, what do I actually do in 5 or 15 minutes? To answer this I'll give some personal examples:

* Have a small conversation to catch up with my younger brother or younger sister
* Go for a small walk and stretch my legs
* Make a cup of green tea
* Refill water bottle
* Briefly check my schedule

The goal of the break should be to give your brain a short rest from consuming and processing information, so that when you come back to the next session, your brain can withold the set of new information without diminishing returns as you have more pomodoro sessions.

These breaks should be tailored around what your lifestyle is like and whatever gives you enough time to reset enough to be focused when you come back to the next session. But be careful to not reset too much to the point where you come back unable to focus. For example, checking your social media may not be ideal for a 5 minute break as it could lead to mindlessly scrolling content for over 10 minutes, as well as not really giving your brain a break from consuming and processing information.
