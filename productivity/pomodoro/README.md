# Pomodoro

**The Pomodoro technique** is a simple method that you help you stay focus during your studying or working sessions. You should prepare the environment to minimize distractions. Start by finding a quiet place where you won’t be disturbed, turn on do not disturb on your phone or devices. After a session, you should take a break for 5 minutes and treat yourself with some sort of rewards, such as coffee or a small walk. You should do 4 of those sessions at a time and take a more extended break of 15–30 minutes.

**My pomodoro technique is to learn/read for 20 minutes, make a summary for 5 minutes, and then break for 5 minutes.**

The pomodoro technique is **science backed**. In the scientific journal "[**Cognition**](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/02/110208131529.htm)" \(_Cognition, Atsunori Ariga, Alejandro Lleras\)._ It was stated that **short breaks and diversions can cause a significant improvement in one’s ability to keep focused on a task** for long periods of time. \(_Cognition, 2011; DOI: 10.1016/j.cognition.2010.12.007\)_

25 Minutes is the preferred time because it takes advantage of a combination of the [**Hermann Ebbinghaus’ Forgetting Curve**](../../cognitive-science/hermann-ebbinghaus-forgetting-curve.md) **** and a specfic note taking method. If we learn for 20 minutes, summarise for 5, and break for 5. We are optimising the amount we remember during a 20 minute session, priming our brain to make new neurological connections during the summary stage, as well as giving our legs and brain a breather to process the information during the break.

Another reason the pomodoro is traditionally 25 minutes is to account for people with a low attention span, likely those with ADHD. Even if you do not have prominent ADHD from genetics, as the digital age has progressed, big online companies have become better at abusing our attention spans to get you to stay on a website longer _\(The Role of Attention in Learning in the Digital Age, Yale J Biol Med\)_, which means more digital media usage_._ [According to a harvard study](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/can-cell-phone-use-cause-adhd-2018073114375), frequent digital media use increased the risk of having symptoms of ADHD by about 10%. Therefore we can conclude that tech use **can** lower attention span, thus **pomodoro's can aid the process of studying with ADHD**. 

It was suggested that the attention span of healthy students \(adults and teenagers\) range from 10 to 20 minutes. This has been [disproven in an experiment](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00986280701291291) as it is too individualistic, based on the student, for example the notes they are taking, how much time they are fully focusing, and such variables.

_I want to add a caveat to this page that factors affecting focus can be extremely variable to an individual, such as age, conditions, environment, situations and more. Thus content should be taken with a grain of salt. Always adapt knowledge to your lifestyle and your biology, since whatever works for you, works._
