# Categories Of Life

Whilst not bound to, I believe there are some meta sub components of human existence, that we as humans conciously, or sub-conciously, strive towards everyday. As a person with a mental illness, I think if these areas are weak, your mind is weak and you are more likely to get anxious and depressed. Essentially, life is misery and suffering if you aren't improving or have improved in life's subcomponents. The sub components as I see them:

## Health

## Fitness

## Emotional Stability

## Intelligence

## Emotions

## Character

## Spirituality

## Love Relationships

## Social Relationships

## Parenting Relationship

## Finances

## Career

## Work

## Quality Of Life
