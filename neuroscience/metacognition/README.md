# Metacognition

Inking your **memory and knowledge together** through narrative. This skill, when applied with **conscious awareness**, is called **metacognition**, _thinking about your thinking_. More than simply thinking about your thinking, you must exercise **self-control** and **make choices** in how you **regulate your cognition** and **learning**.

Knowledge can be visualized like a **tree**, strong **branches** are **major topics** and **smaller branches** that come off those strong branches, are **sub topics**, and **leaves** are sub topics within sub topics. Like an inter connected network.

There are lots of **well qualified, amazing professors** in the **metacognition space**, here are some of my favourites:

* Dr. Cal Newport
* Dr. Barbara Oakley
* James Clear
* David Handel
* Dr. Yana Weinstein
* Psychology Professors at Harvard University
