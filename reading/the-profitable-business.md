# The Profitable Business

## Overview

This book provided some quick and useful insight on creating a successful business and enabling a business to be scalable and sellable with high value. Some of the key take aways are that businesses that are successful are directly proportional to the price of the business.

### Chapter 1: Strategy

Create a strategy for your business, your strategy should differ to a business plan, it is merely a reference point to make sure things are on track.

Envision your success, what do you want out of your business? Is the long term goal to sell it? Pass it onto your children? To scale it bigger?

Determine your values, as well as your companies values an exercise for this would be to list down things that cause you anxiety, and often values can be found in the opposite of the thing you just wrote down. For example, if anger makes you anxious, the corresponding personal value would be kindness. If poor customer support makes you anxious, perhaps consider good customer support to be a strong defining feature of your business.

Find out your MVCs \(Most Valuable Customers/Clients\), they will usually account for a large amount of your revenue. Who are your MVCs? What kind features do they value?

Who is in the market of your niche? What features allow you to stand out? Market research is vital to allowing your business to have a competitive edge over other businesses. If your business has features that your competitor does not, or if your features are more tailored towards the market niche, the business value has more surface area to increase to.

Take measurements! These are your targets such as revenue, turnover, conversion rate, amount of repeat business and amount of new clients.

### Chapter 2: Businesses need to be sellable

The success of a business can be drawn down to it's market worth? Does it sell for a million when similar companies sell for 50 thousand? The million dollar company clearly has a lot of worth in terms of features and business design over it's competitors, as shown with the market value.

Allowing your business to sellable, even if you do not wish to sell it, also opens doors. For example, you could scale it or hand over ownership, opening up other avenues for life.

### Chapter 3: Scaling

There are a few major keys to scaling your business' products or services: Teachability, Value, Repeat Value. 

* Teachability refers to how easily can the task that generates income can be taught or outsourced, as if the product or service is not completely deligated to you, it opens the door to hire someone and generate income for you, essentially if more hands and minds means more money, take the opportunity.
* Value refers to how well the product or service aligns with customers, more importantly, the MVCs. If the service does not reflect the market niche, the value of the business declines. This can be seen in Apple, where after they announced the new iPhone 12 will not come with a charger, their stocks \(value\) declined, as the business move lacked integrity, an important value Apple usually upheld.
* Repeat Value refers to having a recurring revenue model, businesses that tend to use this model scale very well, as well as having a guaranteed income.

By scoring each of the 3 sections out of 10 for each service, you can get a rough outlook on which product is the most rounded, and along with good customer feedback on features, could boost growth of your business.

In terms of resources for scalability, we can look to more unique options, such as hiring a university student for work experience, apprenticeships or outsourcing.

### Chapter 4: Don't put all the eggs in one basket

The major eggs that we can consider in the basket are: MVCs \(key clients\), suppliers and employees.

* No MVC should account for over 15% of your total revenue, as this would make you extremely reliant on one customer. What if that customer were to suddenly leave? Turnover figures would take a big hit. 
* Talk to your MVCs, because they are a large portion of your revenue, find out what features they would like, offer them bespoke software, within reason. The kind of person they are, is also the kind of people you want to be attracting to your business, as those specific kind of people will become your MVCs
* For suppliers, always consider how important you are to them, and how important they are to you? They should be reliable, fast, and offering you the best deals for your suppliers. Also consider if they were to suddenly go under. If they filed for bankruptcy, do you have other supplying companies in place. 
* Consider splitting purchases from suppliers if it works out at a better price, but also negotiate with your main supplier, if you are important and ordering enough, it's possible you could get a nice deal.
* Employees can leave, get sick or become unreliable. 
* Consider having safety nets in place, have you hired someone that can fill the shoes if one of your most valuable employees leave? Have a technical document that details important processes your key employees carry out, having such safety nets allows you to build a strong team, rather than a super strong individual.

### Chapter 5: Cash flow

The most basic re-instated rule applies here, turnover must be greater than expenses. Always track expenses, invoices and overall cash flow, as these help plan your next moves. Buy an online accounting package or have a personal accountant to help manage taxes and such.

Have clear contract signings with your clients. This helps concrete cash flow, reducing deviation and increasing predictablity. If the clients are asking for extra features, or reducing the price if the project is overdue, consider negotiating to an feasable state. This can be done by charging extra, or extending deadlines, written clearly on the contract.

Reserve 10% of monthly income from your business just in case shit happens. A good example of this is when Covid-19 hit, businesses went straight up bankrupt because they had no savings.

Consider tax and VAT, 20% is a lot to consider, and should be considered. Also don't under or over stock, buy just enough supplies to where you are comfortable but have not wasted any finances or time.

### Chapter 6: Customer Satisfaction

This chapter honed in on how important customer feedback is. Send out surverys using a CRM system to see what your customers like, dislike and whether they would reccomend your business to somebody else. These survers should be handed out regularly, as well as when a key event occurs, such as a new service launch. Always deal with customer complains, as fast as possible, if possible.

NPS \(Net Promoter Score\) is a measurement of how satisfied your customers are with your business. Essentially, you send out a survey asking your customers if they would reccomend you to another person, based on a score of likeliness out of ten. This score then falls into one of three categories:

* 9-10 are labelled as promoters, they are your loyal customers
* 7-8 are labelled as passive, they may leave your business for a different one if your value is lower
* 0-6 are called detractors, these are your complainers that would never reccomend you

To calculate your NPS = \(Percentage of promoters\) - \(Percentage of Detractors\). If you have a score of higher than 15, you scored higher than the average. If you have have a score of higher than 72, you are ahead of Apple!

### Chapter 7: Owner Reliance

Delegating tasks to employees frees up your time. It also means that your business could be in secure hands in the future, if you keeping a good technical documentation of key processes. Change doesn't have to occur overnight, you can increase delegation to employees over time to build trust.

Hiring good, loyal employees with plentiful training set you up to be less reliant on yourself for your business. They can also use the technical documention of processes to really have your back and assist you in times where you need it.

Lastly, have an office phone number for feedback and such, it would be a good idea to train all employees on how to manage customers over the phone. Only MVCs should have your personal number. Same idea goes for emails, having one company email that handles feedback, means that you can assign multiple people, such as well trained employees to deal with customer feedback on the fly, freeing you up slightly.

###  Chapter 8: Niche

DO NOT sell on price, ever. Do not have your main priority as cheaper, otherwise the market becomes a race to the bottom. Your marketing messages should be what makes you stand out, your differences to your competitors. Look for trends based on your customer base. Are there specific niches and features your clients tend to skew towards? Speak your MVCs, see what kind of niche features they are after.

### Chapter 9: Recurring Revenue

There are 3 main methods for recurring revenue:

* Consumables: These are your toothpastes, deoderants, and shampoo.
* Sunk money consumables: These consist of products that require consumables, for example razors need shaving cream, certain coffee machines need specific company specific sachets, looking at Nespresso\)
* Subscription based models: These are the most consistent, and make up a lot of the market today, there are a lot of different types out there \(Amazon Prime, Twitch, Huel, Netflix, Spotify\)

Also consider packages, for example tiers for the subscription based model, these increase the size of your net as well as potential customers, as it opens doors for customers with different budgets in mind.

There are also sunk money subs, such as the bloomberg terminal, which is just too good of a service that is unavalible anywhere else. So whilst expensive, it works.
