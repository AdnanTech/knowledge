# Habits

**TLDR: Habits** create a **good system** to change who we **become**, our **identity**. To create good habits, **make them simple** so at first they take **less than 2 minutes** to complete. Slowly **make these harder over time** to avoid the **goldilocks rule**. A day can be measured on how many **good choices** \(**habits**\) we complete. Ways to make good habits stick: **implementation intention \(cue\)**, **communities \(craving\)**, **make good habits easy \(response**\), bad habits hard, **use habit trackers \(reward\)**.

**Better habits means better systems,** **which in turn mean better results**. It all starts with a small improvement, as if we improve by 1 percent each day for a year, that’s 37 times better than where you started. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero. Success is the product of daily habits

Changing our **habits** is challenging for two reasons: 

1. We try to change the wrong thing
2. We try to change our habits in the wrong way This could be because we are unaware of our habits.

**There are 3 layers of behaviour change**, the **process**. ****The **identity** is who we want to become, and the **outcome** is what we want to achieve. To create good habits, we should be focusing on the better version \(identity\) of ourselves we want to become. The reason habits stick is due to it being part of your identity, not because of motivation, motivation leads to outcome based habits

To really change your habits, **2 basic steps** to follow:

1. Decide the type of person you want to be.
2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.

The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.

The cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue. Together, these four steps form a neurological feedback loop that ultimately allows you to create atomic habits. This cycle is known as the habit loop. All habits follow this loop.

### How to Create a Good Habit

1. **Cue. Make it obvious.** The two most common cues are **time** and **location**. The format for creating and implementation intention is: “_When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.” For example: \(if - situational cues\) when I go to bed early, I will read a chapter of a book._ Habit stacking is also effective here. The most disciplined people, do not require self-control as they optimize their environment so that bad habits have almost no exposure. _For example: if I want to stop eating junk food, I will not buy any from the grocery store_
2. **Craving. Make it attractive.** As humans, we imitate the habits of **3 groups**: 
   1. **The close**, The many and the powerful. The close, is joining a culture of like minded people, this advocates the **belonging to a tribe** effect and makes habit sticking more successful. **Discords, blogs, subreddits** to name a few.
   2. **The many**, is **imitating the habits of the tribe** as changing \(identity\) your habits outside of the tribe is challenging the tribe and unattractive. 
   3. **The powerful**, once we fit into the tribe, **we want to stand out from the tribe**, this is why we research the habits of successful people, as we desire to stand out with success. If you reframe your habits to highlight its benefits rather than its drawbacks, it will make a habit seem more attractive
3. **Response**. Make it easy. **Repetition is key** to mastering a habit., once it is performed enough, it becomes automatic and the nonconscious mind takes over. That is why we should make habits easy, the harder they are to begin with, the greater the obstacle is to climb and as a result, they sap a lot of time and energy, so start small start simple. The difference between a **good day and a bad day** is often a few productive and **healthy choices made at decisive moments**. When it's easy to make good choices, the likelihood of having a bad day significantly reduces. See good choice bad choice diagram. When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do. On the flip side, you can make bad habits hard, so the only habits are good, this can be means such as removing social media from your phone, blacklisting certain websites whilst working, only having healthy fruits in the house so energies are always high.
4. **Reward**. Make it satisfying. We a more likely to repeat a behaviour when the **experience is satisfying.** Pleasure teaches your brain that a behaviour is worth remembering and repeating. A **habit tracker** is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit. Habit tracking is powerful because it leverage multiple Laws of Behaviour Change. It simultaneously makes a behaviour obvious, attractive, and satisfying, as completing a habit makes you feel successful. The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit. We optimize for what we measure. When we choose the wrong measurement, we get the wrong behaviour. An accountability partner can create an immediate cost to inaction.

### How to Break a Bad Habit - The Opposite

1. Cue. Make it **invisible**. 
2. Craving. Make it **unattractive**
3. Response. Make it **difficult**
4. Reward. Make it **unsatisfying**

### Some Notes

* Habit stacking increases the likelihood that you’ll stick with a habit by stacking your new behavior on top of an old one.
* The **Goldilocks Rule** states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.
* Maximum motivation occurs when facing a challenge of just manageable difficulty.
* Once a habit has been established, however, it’s important to continue to advance in small ways. These little improvements and new challenges keep you engaged. And if you hit the Goldilocks Zone just right, you can achieve a flow state.
* Mastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny element of success, repeating it until you have internalized the skill, and then using this new habit as the foundation to advance to the next frontier of your development. Each habit unlocks the next level of performance. It’s an endless cycle.
