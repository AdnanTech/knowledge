# Hermann Ebbinghaus’ Forgetting Curve

Ebbinghaus’ forgetting curve brings to light how quickly humans forget newly acquired information if there’s no attempt to retain it.The forgetting curve is a carefully drafted mathematical calculation by Ebbinghaus in the year 1855. The theory suggests that most learners lose newly acquired information within days, weeks, and months of learning – unless the information is consciously repeated and presented in meaningful and different ways.

People forget 40% of what they learned in 20 minutes and 77% of what they learned in six days. People forget 90% after one month. People forget 50-80% of what they’ve learned after one day and 97-98% after a month
