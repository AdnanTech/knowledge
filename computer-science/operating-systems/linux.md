# Linux

Linux is a **kernel**, the linux operating systems are referred to as a GNU \(**G**NU's **N**ot **U**nix, just unix like\) system + Linux, \(ubuntu, kali linux, fedora and more\). Using windows can be viewed like not being able to access the bonnet of a car, for some people that's okay, the car will break down and a mechanic can fix it, for others, they prefer to understand why things operate in the way they do, to better understand when something needs to be upgraded or fixed.

GNU is an operating system and also an extensive collection of utility programmes wholly free software, and also the project within which the free software concept originated.

Reasons to use **linux over windows and mac** are: its customizable, open-source, doesn’t have a financial agenda, its faster, has a tightly knit community so it's more frequently updated, script commands are extremely powerful for carrying out tasks easily and effectively.

Reasons for **programmers** to use linux are: package management system is good, more developer tools, more useful terminal commands, open source. More programming tools are designed with UNIX in mind \(so Linux and OS X\).

Ubutntu seems to be a good place to start, simple with lots of documentation. Kali linux seems a more advanced distro.

The main difference between distros seems to be the tool sets they come with, some are specialized for certain tasks, like kali linux with hacking. Kali linux is a rolling distro, which means it can be run off of a usb stick, since you don’t have to install anything, thus effective for hacking.
