# Workflow

I think my workflow is scoped very large at the moment, I intend to break this down into a more focused workflow where I have one software to handle all of my workflow and note-taking in the future. Perhaps I could build an application on my own. Or integrate everything into GitBook if I purchase the pro version. I have also heard Notion is a good content management system for notes management.
