# Intermittent Fasting

## What is Intermittent Fasting?

[Intermittent fasting](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/what-is-intermittent-fasting) \(IF\) is an eating pattern that cycles between periods of fasting and eating. It doesn’t specify which foods you should eat but rather _when_ you should eat them. In this respect, it’s not a diet in the conventional sense but more accurately described as an eating pattern. Common intermittent fasting methods involve daily 16-hour fasts or fasting for 24 hours, twice per week. Fasting has been a practice throughout human evolution. Ancient hunter-gatherers didn’t have supermarkets, refrigerators or food available year-round. Sometimes they couldn’t find anything to eat. As a result, humans evolved to be able to function without food for extended periods of time.

## What are the benefits?

Health, Mental clarity, fitness and cognitive performance

## Can I chew gum whilst fasting?

I personally do not as chewing gum will make you hungry and increase your insulin, since chewing begins the digestion process so your body will be preparing for food that never comes. Although, it doesn't have any major effect on your fast.

## Can I have multivitamins during a fast?

Because vitamins are fat soluble, they should be taken with food, to reap the maximum benefits. So adjust the timing of consumption of vitamins to when you consume foods with fat, after you break your fast.
