# Biology

//TODO an important concept is that all our biology is adapted to us, as well as general adaptations we all have. We are all adapted to have learning function but we are adapted in the optimal learning function we use to learn. We are also wired to individually having a biological prime time in which our brain is at peak performance \(research if this is malleable and can be changed\)
