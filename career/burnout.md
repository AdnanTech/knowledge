# Burnout

## Identifying burnout

The Maslach Burnout Inventory measures 3 dimensions of burnout:

### Emotional exhaustion

Feeling you can't "give of" yourself anymore; are severely lacking psychological resources

### Depersonalisation/cynicism

Negative attitudes towards others or towards the job \(also: withdrawal or detachment, irritability, negative thoughts towards the job or those you encounter on the job\)

### Reduced personal achievement

The tendency to evaluate yourself and your work negatively \(feeling like you are unaccomplished; like your work is insufficient\)

## Preventing burnout

* Leave work after 8 hours without making excuses
* Go to bed at the same time every night
* Get at least 7 hours of sleep. Try for 8
* Stop drinking alcohol and using drugs
* Eat better. Cook your own meals. Do meal prep to make it easier
* Start exercising. Start 3x per week, 15 min of HIIT per day.
* Drink a large glass of water when you wake up. Drink water throughout the day.
* Don't drink more than one cup of coffee per day
* Don't use sleeping pills
* Work hard during your 8 hours and let it go when you leave
* Say "No" more at work. Do it with a smile
* Do a few minutes of stretching and meditation every day
* Go for a 30-60min walk every day
* Get off of social media. Do more things in the real world
* Spend more time at work conversing with people you like. Invite them to lunch. Go for walks with them. Go for drinks occasionally
* Eliminate all stress-inducing things and people in your life with extreme prejudice
* When you feel fatigued, rest
* Reconnect with true friends and family who lift you up. Disconnect with those that bring you down
* Pick a hobby that makes you happy and do it at least 2x per week
* Push back on everything possible at work. Does someone REALLY need "all the work \[you\] have to do" or are you taking it on unnecessarily. Again, say "No"
* Talk to your boss about taking a break or reducing workload. Let them know you're feeling overwhelmed. Ask for help and/or possibly a change.
