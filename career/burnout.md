# Burnout

## The 3 types of burnout

The Maslach Burnout Inventory measures 3 dimensions of burnout:

### Emotional exhaustion

Feeling you can't "give of" yourself anymore; are severely lacking psychological resources

### Depersonalisation/cynicism

Negative attitudes towards others or towards the job \(also: withdrawal or detachment, irritability, negative thoughts towards the job or those you encounter on the job\)

### Reduced personal achievement

The tendency to evaluate yourself and your work negatively \(feeling like you are unaccomplished; like your work is insufficient\)
