# Computer Science

The 3 stacks of software, as I see it:

* Cloud
* Internet of things \(devices\)
* Embedded systems

A great podcast for AI that I listen to on my commute to my work is the [Lex Fridman Podcast](https://lexfridman.com/podcast/), my favourite episode of his show is his second time with [Stephen Wolfram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t1_ffaFXao&list=PLrAXtmErZgOdP_8GztsuKi9nrraNbKKp4), a mathmetician and computer scientist and theoretical physicist, that talked about the fundamental _variables_ of the universe that we live in, a long with more interesting topics about computer science, philosophy and physics

Refer to my University Notes to read about any topics I have read about whilst being an Undergraduate student at the University Of Sussex.
