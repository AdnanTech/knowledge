# Learning

### Framework

**TLDR:** The most efficient way to learn is **active consumption**, reading it once until you understand all the **core concepts** thoroughly and have written down facts, in a condensed format. We can store at once, **4 chunks** of information in our **short term memory**. Effective ways to consume information is using **pomdoros**, **asking questions**, **exercising** and working in a **team environment**.

**Learning is the acquisition of information**, cells of the nervous system are called neurons. Information from one neuron flows to another neuron across a _synapse_. The human brain has a million billion synapses. Your brain creates synapses whenever you learn something new. Sleeping helps "update" your brain cells.

**Concepts and key facts** are the fundamentals to learn when acquiring knowledge, so you can create an infrastructure of knowledge, that provides a foundation for later on, more complex and abstract ideas.

**Procrastination** occurs because we are thinking about the future and learning new things, which can be daunting and taxing, so it creates anxiety. Since it's easier to think about the present, the area in the brain associated with pain is activated, so it looks to stop that pain sensation by switching your attention to something else. The **Solution** is to just start, then the neuro-discomfort will eventually go away. The better you get at something, the more enjoyable the activity becomes, so the less you will procrastinate to do the activity. 

**The Pomodoro technique** is a simple method that you help you stay focus during your studying or working sessions. You should prepare the environment to minimize distractions. Start by finding a quiet place where you won’t be disturbed, turn on do not disturb on your phone or devices. Most phones would have a timer function that allows you to set one for 25 minutes. After a session, you should take a break for 5 minutes and treat yourself with some sort of rewards such as coffee. You should do 4 of those sessions at a time and take a more extended break of 15–30 minutes.

**Chunks** are **compact packages of information** that are **made simple**, stored in the short term memory. neuro scientifically chunks bond together through use and meaning. Chunking are created when you simplify the information with your undivided attention, to group, see patterns or organise the information. Chunks can be transferred to the long term memory in the brain when they are understood thoroughly and repeatedly applied. We have 4 slots of chunks working memory. They are **used to connect with each other to understand the larger picture** and grasp complex information.

**Exercising** is by far more effective than any drug to help you learn better. It helps new neurons survive. Blood flow increases during exercise, which means more energy and more oxygen, this aid help brain performance.

**Teamwork** find focused people to analyse and brainstorm your work with. Your errors are sometimes easier to be found by others. Explaining yourself to others helps you understand more. Studying in a team helps you catch what you missed, or what you can’t see. Don’t fool yourself. Don’t blindly believe in your intellectual abilities. Having a team can bring those projections down.

**Brainstorm** when you are out of ideas or feel like you have a lot of questions, step back and go into brainstorm mode. Mind map, draw ideas, ask questions, make connections Shift the focus.

**Subtle difference between knowledge and information**: The main difference is that knowledge requires an agent \(a person to understand the information at the fundamental level\). We might have information about computer networks stored in a textbook, but unless someone is around to read the textbook and learn its contents there will be no knowledge of computer networks.

### **Exams**

**Test Checklist:**

* Did you make a serious effort to understand the text?
* If you had a study guide, did you go through it?
* Did you attempt to outline every homework problem solution?
* Did you understand all your homework problems’ solutions?
* If not, did you ask for explanations?
* Did you work with classmates on homework problems? checked your solutions?
* Did you consult your instructor/teacher when you had a problem with something?
* Did you sleep well the night before the test?

**Test Taking Technique:** 

* Hard Start - Jump to easy: \(Try this strategy with homework problems first\) 
  * Take a quick look at the test when it’s handed to you to get a sense of what it involves
  * Start with the hardest problem. Pull yourself out if you get stuck for over 2 minutes. _Starting with a hard problem loads your focused mode first and then switches attention away from it. This allows the diffused mode to start its work_
  * Turn next to an easy problem. Solves what you can, then move back to a hard one. _This allows the different part of your brain to work simultaneously on different thoughts_

**Taking Test Tips**:

* Being Stressed before a test is normal. The body puts ups out chemicals when it’s under stress. How you interpret the body reaction to those chemicals makes all the difference
  * Shift your thinking from "I am afraid of this test" to “I am excited to do my best”
* If you are stressed during a test, turn your attention to breathing. Relax, put your hand on your stomach and slowly draw some deep breaths. This will calm you down
* Relax your brain on the last day before a test. Have a quick final look at the materials. Feeling guilty the last day is a natural reaction even if you prepared well. So relax
* Good worry motivates you. Bad worry wastes your energy
* Double check your answers. Look away, shift your attention, and then recheck

Elon Musk's advice is to view knowledge as a \(semantic\) tree. Making sure you start with the fundamental principles of a topic \(Trunk and big branches\), before you get into the smaller details \(leaves\), or there is nothing for the leaves \(details\) to hang onto

### Learning How To Learn Summary

* There are two modes of thinking: 
  * **Focused mode:** Concentrating on things that are usually familiar
  * **Diffused mode:** A relaxed mode of thinking "your thoughts are free to wander"
* When you learn something new, make sure to take time to rest, then come back to it and recall what you learnt
* This is very important. **Don’t cram** information in one day. This leads to inefficient learning. It’s like building a wall without letting it dry
* **Revisiting** and practicing what you learn is important. Research shows that **spaced repetition** \(repeating things after few days\) is the best way to build and strengthen the synaptic connections
* **Sleep** is very important. It clears the metabolic toxins from the brain after a day of "brain use". It is best to sleep directly after learning new things
* It was shown that **exercising** and/or being in a **rich social environment** helps your brain produce new neurons. Don’t lock yourself in your room. Stay active and spare time for exercise \(including general physical activities\) and friends daily.

**Turn off distractions**. You want to use all the four slots of your working memory when studying. Learning will be inefficient if some of those slots are connected to something else.

**You have to solve the problem yourself**. Just because you see it, or even understand it, doesn't mean that you will be able to solve it \(**Illusion of competence**\). It is always easier to look at the material, even if you think it’s easy, then doing it yourself.

**It gets easier**. When you think that a chapter or a book has too much information and that there’s no way to go through them all; just focus on whatever section you’re studying. You’ll find that once you put that first concept in your mental library, the following one will be easier. This concept is called **Transfer**; a chunk you have mastered in one area can often help you much more easily learn other chunks of information in different areas.

**Master the major idea** and then start getting deeper. However, make sure not to get stuck in some details before having a general idea. Practice to help yourself gain mastery and sense of the big picture context. Try taking a "picture walk" before you dig through the material, this means, look briefly at the pictures, chapter titles, formulas used… before diving into details.

**Recall mentally** without looking at the material. This is proven more effective than to simply rereading. Reread only after you try to recall and write down what was in the material. Consider recalling when you are in **different places** to become independent of the cues from any giving location. This will help you when taking a test in the class.

**Test yourself** to make sure you are actually learning and not fooling yourself into learning. Mistakes are a good thing. They allow you to catch illusions of competence.

**Don’t always trust your initial intuition**. Einstellung problem \(a German word for Mindset\). An idea or a neural pattern you developed might prevent a new better idea from being found. Sometimes your initial intuition on what you need to be doing is misleading. You've to unlearn old ideas and approaches as you are learning new ones.

**Mix up the problems \(Interleaving\)** from different chapters. This is helpful to create connections between your chunks. It can make your learning a bit more difficult, but it helps you learn more deeply. Interleaving is very important. It is where you leave the world of practice and repetition, and begin thinking more independently.

Don’ts:

* Highlighting too much and creating maps are often ineffective without recalling
* Repeating something you already learnt or know very well is easy. It can bring the illusion of competence; that you’ve mastered the full material when you actually just know the easy stuff. Balance your studies and focus on the more difficult \(**deliberate practice**\). This sets the difference between a good student and a great student
* A big mistake is to blindly start working on an exercise without reading the textbook or attending the class. This is a recipe of sinking. It’s like randomly allowing a thought to pop off in the focus mode without paying attention to where the solution truly lies

The **first time** you do something the stream of information coming at you would make the job seem almost impossibly difficult. But, once you've chunked it, it will be simple. At first, it's really hard, later it's easy. It becomes like a habit. A good example is driving, for the first time, it's very hard, now its very easy

**Weekly/daily lists** are important. Researchers showed that writing your daily/weekly list the **evening before** helps you accomplish them the next day. If you don’t write them down, they will take the valuable slots of memory. Plan your finishing time, this is as important as planning your working time. Work in the most important and most disliked task first, even if it’s only one pomodoro. Take notes about what works and what doesn’t. Have a backup plan for when you will still procrastinate

**Focus on the process.** You should realize that it’s perfectly normal to start a learning session with a negative feeling even if you like the subject. It’s how you handle those feelings that matters. Solution: Focus on the process, not the product. The product is what triggers the pain that causes you to procrastinate. Instead of saying "I will solve this task today", put your best effort for a period of time continuously over the days.

**Metaphors and analogies are very helpful**, not only to memorize, but to also understand different concepts. It is often helpful to pretend that you are the concept you’re trying to understand.

**Intelligence does matter.** Being smart usually equate to having a large working memory \(more than just four slots\). However, a super working memory can hold its thoughts so tightly that new thoughts won’t easily find a way into the brain. Such a tightly controlled attention could use an occasional breath of ADHD. You attention shifts even if you don’t want it to shift. Deliberate practice is what helps the average brain lift into the realm of those naturally gifted. Practicing certain mental patterns deepens your mind. Brilliant scientist like Ramón y Cajal, the father of neuroscience, or Charles Darwin, were not exceptionally gifted. The key to their success was perseverance, taking responsibility for their learning and changing their thoughts. Take pride in the qualities you excel at. Tune people out if they try to demean your efforts.

**Learning doesn't always progress linearly and logically**. Inevitably your brain will hit a knowledge-collapse sometimes. This usually means your brain is restructuring its understanding, building a more solid foundation. You learn complex concepts by trying to make sense out of the information you perceive. Not by having someone else telling it to you.

**It’s normal to feel like there is always more to learn**, that’s usually because there is, but don’t forget to constantly make summaries and/or recall material to not forget the information about the topic

The order for most effective study routines: 

* 1st is rehearsal and testing
* 2nd is testing with no rehearsal
* 3rd is rehearsal with no testing
