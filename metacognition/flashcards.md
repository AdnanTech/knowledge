# Flashcards



**Flashcards** are arguably, the best source for increasing memory-retireval of a topic you are already knowledgeable about. **Retrieval practice.**

### **2 key concepts when making flashcards:**

1. **How to create good flashcards for retrieval practice**
2. **How to practice flashcards for optimal effect.**

### **Anecdotal tips from David Hansell**

**For creating good flashcards:**

* **Understand the concept fully** first before you create flashcards. **Learn before you memorise**. Keep them short and sweet, don’t use other peoples as its not personal and likely bloated.
* **Write down potential flash cards whilst learning** the topic/reading. Read once and create flashcards as you work your way through the material.
* Draft the question and answer of a flashcard from memory, before checking with a textbook and finalising the flashcards. Personal flashcards in my own words \(re-wording\) are more effective to learn than a textbook definition.
* **1 question to 1 answer** ratio on a flash card. 
* Hardest flash cards are **1 flashcard to many items** of recall. **Avoid these** if possible.
* **Questions must be concise** and clear, minimise words **but maximise effectiveness**. Anyone should be able to understand what you are asking even if they don’t know about it. None of "vim?", instead create a flash card to say "Why is vim useful?". Helps future proof flashcards.
* **Questions must aid the answer** to help it be retrieved from memory, **but not give away the answer**.
* **Question should be longer than the answer**, short answers are also good to challenge connections and think about what else there is to the answer, the connections. 
* **Answers to flashcards should be shor**t, simple and specific.
* **Words and images** for questions make for **better recall**, this is called **dual coding**
* **You can use images for the question**, as long as it’s a labelled image/provokes missing in the missing details
* **Make use of styling**, such as **colours**, **bold** or **italics**, font sizes, highlighting to enhance recallability 
* Use **humour**, **real world** or **personal examples** to remember it better
* Flashcards should be either **what you want or need to remember,** and should only those concepts.
* Create flashcards that **have the answer first,** and some that have the question first. A good example of this would be for pseudocode. On one side have the algorithm, and on the other side have the algorithm name. would work especially well with searches and sorts.
* Break down **bigger concepts into smaller pieces to flashcard**. So operating systems are a big thing, break it down into unix, unix like and non unix, then break it down further to talk about ubuntu and macOS, as apposed to Windows and such. 
* **Use tags** for your flashcards, this can make **grouping them** easier to see weaker areas 
* Add a metacognitive **question at the end of the answer**, to make sure you are paying attention and connecting the concepts you are learning about the other concepts. For example, if we ask a question about Linux, at the end of the question, ask how linux has impacted the industry and such. 
* Fill in the blanks can be effective, but they're like training wheels for learning.
* **Open ended questions** or multiple choice are better than fill in the blanks, as it challenges you more, so makes the brain connect the synapses stronger.
* Use flashcards to **connect areas of knowledge** - creating a knowledge tree is key to learning.
* **Whys are better than what's**, for example, if we ask what is vim, we get a narrow response, a text editor, but if we ask why is vim useful, we get a more open question.
* Create **multiple flashcards for one topic** to view it from **different angles** to enhance your learning.
* Be very thoughtful of your flashcard collection, **the less you make, the better**, as you will have to recall less, and can focus more on the tightly knit woven flashcards you have created already.

**For practicing flashcards:**

* Don’t turn over flashcard until you can answer it, or have tried your absolute hardest to answer it, even a failed attempt makes you remember the answer better next time
* Use tags to group topics, so you can target flashcards from different topics when need be 
* Use spaced repetition AND manually study your recalls, this means going beyond just recalling the daily selected flash cards, review topics you feel weak on. 
* If on the go, use the anki app
* Respond to flashcards out loud, promotes metacognition
* Type out the answer of the flash card before you answer it. Then compare, whilst not optimal on the go, if at a desk or whatever then use this technique.
* Edit cards when you have a better understanding of a topic, highlight parts that are hard, refactor the flashcard set.
* If you really struggle to answer, read the notes in the personal wiki on the topic, or online sources.
* Variate study time, by being in new environments you create new patterns and strengthen the patterns that already exist
* Practicing before you sleep is every effective to consolidate memory. 
* Break up flash cards sessions - if you have one hundred to do in the day, do 50 in the morning and 50 after dinner, this prevents losing focus

**For large collections of items:**

* First thing is to identify if it’s a set or an enumeration, as enumerations are harder. A set is a collection of objects that are related, where the order doesn’t matter. An enumeration is a list of objects where the order does matter. For example, list of fruits is a set, pi to 10 digits is an enumeration
* Break it down into smaller flashcards, as subsets of the larger set. So fill in the blanks, or breaking down the set into a few specific sets.
* Use mnemonics
