# Categories Of Life

Whilst not bound to, I believe there are some meta sub components of human existence, that we as humans conciously, or sub-conciously, strive towards everyday. As a person with a mental illness, I think if these areas are weak, your mind is weak and you are more likely to get anxious and depressed. Essentially, life is misery and suffering if you aren't improving or have improved in life's subcomponents. The sub components as I see them:

## Health

How are you sleeping? What is your diet like? Are your health conditions in check?

## Fitness

What do you want to weigh? How do you want to feel? When do you want to complete your first marathon? How active are you?
