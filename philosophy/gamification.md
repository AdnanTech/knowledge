# Gamification

//TODO Go more in-depth

Gamification is an interesting theory I have been contemplating about recently. Essentially, thinking of _life_ itself as a _game_. Life can be seen as one big mmorpg. The word game can be ambigous, perhaps this is a topic that needs tangible tests, similar to [Turing's paper on machine intelligence](../people/alan-turing.md#computing-machinery-and-intelligence).

For example, as a freelancer, you start at level 1 with no skills, struggle to defeat enemies \(tasks and projects\), and the process can seem slow. Once you level up your skills \(optimizing design and coding process\), defeat more high level enemies \(bigger projects\), you get to a point where you can grind out enemies \(tasks\) faster, with better weapons \(tools\). This means you level up faster \(get paid more, complete more projects\), which shows exponential growth.

The concept of mana as energy as well, increased by food and sleep whilst depleting during the day when doing tasks.
